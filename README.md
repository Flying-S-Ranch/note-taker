# Note-Taker

## Description
This project allows users to record and store notes in a handy format. I enjoyed the process of connecting front-end and back-end javascript. This project used express js, node js, insomnia, and is deployed on Heroku. I enjoyed the debugging process and felt very satisfied when the file connected to the server for the first time. This project is built upon starter code provided by the full-stack bootcamp.

## Installation
The deployed webpage can be found here: https://serene-island-74636-242dfceeb9fc.herokuapp.com/. There are no special instructions for installation.

## Usage
On the first page users can click the 'Get Started' button. This will take the user to the notes page. Archived notes are on the left, and the right side is a space to enter new notes.
Note: at the moment this app is not fully functional; while it is possible to add notes using Insomnia, users cannot save new notes on the deployed page. I will continue working until the page is fully functional.

## Credits
The server.js, notes.js, fsUtils.js, and index.js files were written following the examples found in the module 11 mini-project. The mini-project was very helpful in many respects and gave me a model of what I needed to do to make this app functional.
